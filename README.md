## Installation

To use the project, clone the root directory to your local machine. You will need NODE.js to run the application. Once the code is on your machine run ```npm install``` to install the node packages that the project needs. Once that has completed, run ```npm run build``` followed by ```npm run start:dev```. The application should start running at http://localhost:3001.

## Usage

Once at the webpage, you'll see this page.

![Home page with a single start quiz button](./assets/startQuiz.png)

Click on the "Start Quiz" button to get going! You'll be asked a series of 10 multiple choice questions that look like this.

![A quiz question with a question and 4 choices to answer, each choice having a corresponding button labelled as 1-4](./assets/question.png)

Select the button (labelled as 1-4) next to the answer that you believe responds correctly to the question. You'll do this for all 10 questions. Once you've completed the quiz, you'll see this page, which will present your score and give you the option to take the quiz again.

That's pretty much it. As always, feel free to play around with the site and make sure to report any bugs!
